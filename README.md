Where feature_1 to feature_n are the pathway enrichment scores and the chemical fingerprint coming from data processing
# Usage:
```python
# run FNN 
python ./PathDSP/FNN.py -i input.txt -o ./output_prefix

Where input.txt should be in the input format shown above.

# Data preprocessing
Pathway enrichment scores for categorical data (i.e., mutation, copy number variation, and drug targets) were obtained by running the NetPEA algorithm, which is available at: https://github.com/TangYiChing/NetPEA, while pathway enrichment scores for numeric data (i.e., gene expression) was generated with the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analsysis (ssGSEA) available here: https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/gseapy_example.html#3)-command-line-usage-of-single-sample-gseaby
